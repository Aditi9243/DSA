Problem Statement : Inversion count in Array (using Merge Sort)

Given an array arr[]. The task is to find the inversion count of arr[]. Where two elements arr[i] and arr[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.

Input: arr[] = {8, 4, 2, 1}
Output: 6
Explanation: Given array has six inversions: (8, 4), (4, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (4, 1), (2, 1).
